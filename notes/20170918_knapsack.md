# Knapsack etc


## Algo description

Problem: 
- items 1,2,...n
- weights w_1, w_2, ...w_n
- values v_1, v_2, ... v_n
- what is the  most valuable combination of items whose total weight is <= W? 


### Algo
With repetition: recursive form of solution

$K(w)$ = most valuable combo whose weight is $\leq w$, s.t., $0 \leq w \leq W$
$K(w) = max {K(w - w_i) + v_i) } , w_i \leq w$ 

### Details

Algorithm below: 

	* Initialization: 
		for w = 0 to w:
			K(w) = 0
			last(w) = 0

	* Memoization:
		for w = 1 to W:
			for i=1 to n:
				if w_i <= W:
					K(w) := max{K(w), K(w-w_i) + V_i}
					if K(w-w_i) + V_i is the max:
						then last(w) = i
		return K(W)


RUnning time: O(nW). You loop thru W and loop thru n inside of that. 

## Example: 4 items

| item | weight | value
=======================
| 1 | 6 | $30 | 
| 2 | 3 | $14 | 
| 3 | 4 | $16 |
| 4 | 2 | $9 | 


Let W = 10 ; this is the max you can fit in your knapsack

### With repetition: 
each item has unlimited number of copies
item 1, 2 copies of item 4
total weight = 10 / value = 48

### Without reptition:
each item has one copy only
item 1, item 3
total weight 10 / value = 46


### drawing:

$$ K(7) = max \{K(7-6)+30 , K(7-3)+14, K(7-4)+16, K(7-2)+9 } $$

Output used items

	for i = 1 .. n:
		Copes(i) := 0
	w := W
		while w > 0:
			copies(i) := copies(i) + last(w)
			w := w - V_last(w)
